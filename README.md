# Birb Simulator

Small project that generates a terrain using Simpex2D noise and also uses chunks to render it more efficiently.
I followed [Sebastian Lagues Terrain Rendering Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3).

I was mostly interested in the terrain rendering part but most of the time I had to tinker around with the chunk generation, which taught me a lot but is kinda boring.
That's why I'm not going to keep working on this project anymore.

Here's a short demo (very short because of file size limit):
